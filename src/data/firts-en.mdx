## Tired of Unorganized and Messy CSS Code? Consider Using BEM Helper in Visual Studio for Better Structure!

If you're tired of dealing with disorganized and cluttered CSS code, you may want to consider using the BEM methodology to help structure your code in a more modular and maintainable way. To make the implementation of BEM even easier, you can use BEM Helper, a Visual Studio extension that provides autocompletion for BEM classes.

Here's how to get started with BEM Helper:

### Step 1: Install the BEM Helper Extension

First, you need to install the BEM Helper extension in Visual Studio. You can do this by going to the "Extensions" menu, selecting "Manage Extensions," and then searching for "BEM Helper" in the Marketplace tab. Click "Install" and restart Visual Studio.

### Step 2: Start Using BEM Classes

Once the extension is installed, you can start using BEM classes in your CSS code. BEM stands for Block, Element, Modifier, and the naming convention helps you identify the purpose of each class.

For example, suppose you have a block called "menu" with two elements: "item" and "link." To style the "menu" block, you would use the ".menu" class. To style the "item" element, you would use the ".menuitem" class. If you wanted to add a modifier to the "item" to change its appearance, you would use the ".menu\*\*item--active" class.

### Step 3: Use BEM Helper for Autocompletion

To facilitate the use of BEM classes, you can use the BEM Helper for autocompletion. When you start typing a BEM class in your CSS code, the extension will display a dropdown menu with suggestions for BEM classes that match what you're typing. You can then select the desired class, and BEM Helper will complete it for you.

In conclusion, if you're looking for a way to improve your CSS organization and productivity, consider using the BEM methodology and BEM Helper in Visual Studio. With a little practice, you'll soon be writing better CSS code in no time.
